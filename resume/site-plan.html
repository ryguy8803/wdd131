As an Assistant Manager at Jimmy John's, I played a pivotal role in ensuring the seamless operation of a consistently fast-paced and high-volume environment. Beyond the core task of crafting perfect sandwiches, I was directly instrumental in managing all facets of daily operations. This encompassed everything from meticulous inventory control, ensuring optimal stock levels and minimizing waste, to accurate cash handling and reconciliation, maintaining financial integrity. A significant part of my role involved supervising and motivating the team, fostering a collaborative and efficient workspace. I was responsible for training new hires, ensuring they quickly grasped our "freaky fast" service model and adhered to our rigorous food safety and quality standards.
Moreover, I actively engaged with customers, addressing any concerns and guaranteeing every individual received the exceptional service Jimmy John's is known for, directly contributing to customer loyalty and repeat business. I also took ownership of maintaining store cleanliness and organization, creating a welcoming atmosphere for both staff and patrons. Essentially, I served as a critical on-site leader, making rapid decisions to navigate challenges, optimize workflows, and uphold brand standards. I was the backbone of the store's smooth functioning, directly contributing to its efficiency, profitability, and the cultivation of a positive, high-performing team culture.

Exceptional Time Management: I consistently meet deadlines and maintain a flawless record of punctuality for all commitments, adhering to the principle that "to be early is to be on time." This proactive approach ensures efficient task completion and dependable attendance.


Decisive Leadership: My experience in various employment and mission leadership roles has cultivated a strong ability to foster inclusive environments and strategically delegate responsibilities, maximizing team engagement and productivity.


Unwavering Integrity: I am deeply committed to upholding my commitments, consistently following through on promises and tasks with steadfast reliability and honesty.


Articulate Communication: I confidently articulate ideas and opinions, readily seek clarification or assistance when needed, and consistently engage with colleagues and peers through clear, empathetic, and constructive dialogue.


Confident Public Speaking: I possess a strong aptitude for public speaking, capably delivering presentations and addressing diverse audiences, even with minimal preparation.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I was called to the Guyana Georgetown Mission (formerly known as the Trinidad Port of Spain Mission). Each day I was required to talk to strangers, make intricate plans and schedules, construct and report statistics throughout the week, study extensively about the gospel, and serve others. I was unpaid, obedient to the missionary rules, and went out everyday whether it was rain or shine while serving in Guyana and Trinidad. I was placed in foreign and uncomfortable situations every day and made calm collected decisions under pressure.

        description: Lilith is an AI program that I developed in Python. It uses an early version of GPT and has an API key that connects with it. The program will wait and listen for voice input. Once it receives input it will send the text to the AI to process and then it will respond using text to voice.

        title: Goal Tracking program Dev5
        desc: This goal tracker program can create new goals, list all goals, save the goals to a file, load files, and keep track of how many times you've done a goal or if you completed it. There are two different types of goals are temporary or permanent. You can set a limit of how much you'd like to do the temporary goals and they will go away once you have hit that limit. The permanent goals will stay but it'll still keep track of your progress.
